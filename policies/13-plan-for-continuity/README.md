### Compliant

To ensure the policy is `COMPLIANT` you can enable sharing data by following the steps below:

1. In the Admin console, go to `Menu` > `Account` > `Account settings` > `Legal and compliance`
2. Click `Sharing options`
3. To share data, click `Enabled`
4. Click `Save`

### Warn

If this policy is found to be `WARN` please ensure the steps for enabling data sharing (found under `Compliant`) have been followed.

If the steps have been followed, then you may need to generate logs by interacting with the Google Workspace Admin Console (logging in at admin.google.com should be good enough). This is due to logs only being pulled for the last 7 days, so could just be a period of inactivity.

## 01-file-check.rego

Check for the presence of two (2) files in the `guardrail-01` Google Cloud Storage Bucket:

- Break Glass account Procedure
- MFA Policy Enforcement

### Policy Flow Diagram

![01-file-check](../policy_diagrams/01-file-check.png "01-file-check.rego")

### Compliant

To ensure the policy is `COMPLIANT` you should ensure that the two (2) files required are present in the `guardrail-01` Google Cloud Storage Bucket:

- Break Glass account Procedure
- MFA Policy Enforcement

> NOTE: Due to not being able to guarantee what name the file(s) will be, this policy will only check that the number of files present exceeds the minimum number required (including the default instructions.txt file).

### Non-Compliant

If this policy is found to be `NON-COMPLIANT` you should ensure that the two (2) files required are present in the `guardrail-01` Google Cloud Storage Bucket:

- Break Glass account Procedure
- MFA Policy Enforcement

You may also want to ensure that the default instructions.txt file is still present as well.

Finally, you may need to alter the `required_file_count` value inside `01-file-check.rego` to set what the minimum required number of files should be (including the default instructions.txt).
